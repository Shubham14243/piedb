## Getting Started

Installing piedb

```bash
  pip install piedb --upgrade
```

Initializing Database

When you initialize PieDB, it automatically detects an existing database or creates a new one if it doesn't exist.

```bash
  from piedb import Database

  # Default database (creates "database.json" if not found)
  db = Database()

  # Custom database (creates "mydb.json" if not found)
  db = Database("mydb")
```
## Working with Collections

Creating Collections

```bash
  # Create collection without schema
  db.collection("users")
```

Updating Collection Schema

```bash
  # Define schema using all supported data types
  user_schema = {
      "name": str,       # String
      "age": int,        # Integer
      "balance": float,  # Float
      "is_active": bool, # Boolean
      "address": dict,   # Dictionary
      "hobbies": list,   # List
      "created_at": datetime  # Datetime (ISO format)
  }

  # Create/Update collection with schema
  db.collection("users", schema=user_schema)
```
